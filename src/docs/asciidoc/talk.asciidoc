== A tiny bit about some previous hackathons

* the kinds of relationships that our Hackathons have created and work that they've led to

== What is a Hackathon?

=== Philosophy

* Fundamentally about relationships
* Building things is only one of many outputs
  ** new ideas
  ** new collaborations
  ** new skills/techniques
  ** ..

=== Technology as tools

* technology as tools and tools for expression, rather than ends in themselves
  ** walk through idea testing for storyTrails/Droplets
  ** just used a mobile phone - WoZ
  ** what kinds of outputs are appropriate

=== What do you want to get out of this?

* ???

== Our focus / theme

* putting the user first
  ** user experience led
  ** also exploring cultural and creative ideas - putting technology in the service of that, in the design process

=== themes - perhaps Art; Techonlogy; Social Change/Good

* what present in your minds now (whatever now means)
* things you've seen or heard of recently

=== interests?

* what you are interested in, generally, rather than what you are working on right now
  ** the wider set of things you're interested in - the 50+ list

=== summary

* how you can use creative practices and engagement with technologies to create positive social impact
  ** where do you think you can create positive social impact?
  ** brings it back to the "user", then ask how

== Processes and Practicalilties

=== Ideation and idea selection

* a big part of the process
* always a challenge with a variety of people
  ** especially when we don't really know each other
  ** (though that's half the point)

=== Suggested approach

. Talk a bunch during morning Tea
  ** trying to find ideas of interest between people
. Write loosely formed ideas on paper
  ** unfiltered
. Go around and mark ideas you find interesting
. Vote with our feet


== Notes



* keep it grounded in the kinds of relationships that our Hackathons have created and work that they've led to
* talk about me a little
* talk about philosophy of hackathons? and the process - some kind of framing and framework for the two days
  ** process for ideation and idea selection
  **
* talk about thinking about technology as tools and tools for expression, rather than ends in themselves
  ** walk through idea testing for storyTrails/Droplets
  ** just used a mobile phone - WoZ
  ** what kinds of outputs are appropriate

* Group sizes and skills distribution

* want cross-discipline interaction
  ** people having opportunity to work with other kinds of people and processes.



"generate new ideas, new creative collaborations, and to seed the ground for amazing new work: prototypes, designs, or artworks. The only remit for the work is that it makes someone's life better: by solving a problem, helping a user or a group to overcome a challenge - or by creating something beautiful!"

* what's important to individuals?

* asdf
  ** putting the user first
  ** user experience led
  ** also exploring cultural and creative ideas - putting technology in the service of that, in the design process

* tension
  ** being guided by technologies afford
  ** but still user led

* some artificial constraints?
  ** at least for ideation?
  ** themes - perhaps Art; Techonlogy; Social Change/Good
  ** what present in people's minds now (whatever now means)
  ** what things people seen or heard of etc recently

* what you are interested in, generally, rather than what you are working on right now
  ** the wider set of things you're interested in - the 50+ list

* how you can use creative practices and engagement with technologies to create positive social impact
  ** where do you think you can create positive social impact?
  ** brings it back to the "user", then ask how
